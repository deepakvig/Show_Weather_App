=== Development Process

The process used to develop this app are as follows :-

1. I started off with a blank rails application configured with rvm to use ruby 2.3.0
2. Added testing suite (rspec, capybara..)
3. Added an initial feature for the home page (not passing at this point)
4. Added controller with spec and routing spec as I use rspec to unit test the lower level detail
5. Added twitter bootstrap for styling
6. README updated and format changed to rdoc
7. Added Location model with spec
8. 'random-location' gem added which returns latitude and longitude for a location near to a coordinate
9. Reference latitude and longitude 0,0 added with a distance range 10,000 km for 'random-location'
10. Added Weather_Detail module with specs
11. Added 'webmock' gem to stub get request with predefined data
12. Updated Location model to support fetching weather details using Weather Detail module with specs
13. Update Forecasts Controller to get random locations with weather details
14. Added Locations Controller, search form and libs added to location model, Specs added for routes, form and controller
15. Added Location model validation for checking city presence, specs added
16. Added Weather Details section to view Details of searched Location, specs added. Ajax form added. Locations controller update and specs added
17. Validation added to match typed in City name with the response


=== Things to improve

1. Add caching for fetched weather data
2. Refactor Location model some more
3. Add Google map for showing the location of city and also same for the random geo coordinates that are shown
