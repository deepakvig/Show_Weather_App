=== Development Process

The process used to develop this app are as follows :-

1. I started off with a blank rails application configured with rvm to use ruby 2.3.0
2. Added testing suite (rspec, capybara..)
3. Added an initial feature for the home page (not passing at this point)
4. Added controller with spec and routing spec as I use rspec to unit test the lower level detail
5. Added twitter bootstrap for styling
6. README updated and format changed to rdoc
